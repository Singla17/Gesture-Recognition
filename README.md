# Hand Gesture Recognition using Radar Imagery

In this work we have used [Soli Dataset](https://github.com/simonwsw/deep-soli), We have experiemented with CNN and LSTM architectures.     
Out results are as follows:
| Model | 50-50 Split | Leave one user Out | Leave One Session Out |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------|  
| Single Layered LSTM| 98.97% | 92.90% | 95.92% |
| Double Layered LSTM| 99.04% | 92.07% | 96.25%|
